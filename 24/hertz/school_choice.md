Question 3 Essay - What are the considerations involved in your choice of graduate school?

Harvard combines my intellectual and policy interests in sustainability. My adviser, Prof. Joonho Lee, is an expert in applying quantum chemistry to the condensed phase. Specifically, to improve the simulation of strongly correlated materials, we want to move past the GW approximation with the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) theory of statistical physics. For strongly correlated systems, the position of an electron is strongly influenced by the proximity of its peers, and so their electrostatic interaction is large, and it does not make sense to treat this interaction as a mere perturbation, as is done in GW. MZ offers an alternative by instead performing the perturbative Taylor expansion in the evolution time. But apart from the academic jargon, Harvard has the top school in public policy, the Kennedy School, where influential people come regularly to give talks. My work applying Green's functions to solid-state systems will make the development of more efficient solar cells possible. I want to then help figure out how to bring these solar panels to the consumer. I will attend these policy talks as my schedule permits.
