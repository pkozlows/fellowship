Question 2 Essay - How does your proposed field of study and career constitute an application of the physical sciences or engineering?

Quantum chemistry is theoretical. While I regularly see the electronic structure of chemicals on a computer, it is never in the laboratory. But the lab is what matters. In particular, people use spectroscopy to probe the core electrons in an atom with lasers. This is not new, but doing so at an attosecond time scale ($10^{-18} s) is, as evidenced by the Nobel Prize awarded in 2023. Such a short time scale lends high resolution to chemical bonding events, which allows for the design of improved materials with sustainable applications, like photovoltaics or heterogeneous catalysts. Spectroscopists doing this, like my recommender Scott Cushing, inform their experiments with computation. For this computation to be useful, we quantum chemists need to improve the status quo, which poorly treats electrons whose positions strongly depend on that of their peers (aptly named strongly correlated).
