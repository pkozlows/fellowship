Question 1 Essay - How did you choose your field and what are your primary expectations of your future career?

My first encounter using quantum chemistry simulation amidst inorganic chemistry research with Prof. Hadt left me fascinated by the intersection of chemistry and computation. I was introduced to the intricacies of these quantum chemistry methods in sustainability-focused heterogeneous catalysis research with Prof. Garnet Chan the following year. After my stroke, the AI coding tools enabled me to return to my former passion. During the past year, I have been introduced to the wonders of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). With mean field references, like density functional theory (DFT), constantly improving, we can be economical by using them as a starting point for corrections with perturbation theory. In addition to the intellectual pleasure I derive from MBPT, I am drawn to the fact that improvements in it can help create more efficient solar panels. My overall goal is to contribute to the sustainability movement; academically, I will do so by gaining expertise applying Green's functions to MBPT, but more broadly I want to explore how I could use my disabled identity at Harvard to make a public policy impact.
